# Blood-Bank-Management-System
DBMS - 18CSC303J
### Problem Statement
The development of a web-based Blood Bank Management
System (BBMS) is proposed to provide management
functions to the blood bank. It is a Web Application through
which registered hospitals can check the availability of
required blood and can send requests for blood to the nearest
blood bank. A blood bank can also send a request to another
blood bank for unavailable blood. People willing to donate
blood can find out the nearest blood banks using the system
and the location of the blood bank would be traced using
maps
