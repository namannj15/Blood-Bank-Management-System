# Blood-Bank-Management-System
DBMS - 18CSC303J
### Problem Statement
The development of a web-based Blood Bank Management
System (BBMS) is proposed to provide management
functions to the blood bank. It is a Web Application through
which registered hospitals can check the availability of
required blood and can send requests for blood to the nearest
blood bank. A blood bank can also send a request to another
blood bank for unavailable blood. People willing to donate
blood can find out the nearest blood banks using the system
and the location of the blood bank would be traced using
maps
### Objectives
The goal of the project is to develop a web
application for blood banks to manage information
about their donors and blood stock. The main
objectives of this website development can be
defined as follows:
- To develop a system that provides functions to
support donors to view and manage their
information conveniently.

- To maintain records of blood donors, blood
donation information and bloodstocks in a
centralized database system.

- To inform donors of their blood result after
their donation.

- To support searching, matching and
requesting for blood convenient for
administrators.

- To provide a function to send an E-mail
directly to the donor for their useraccount and
the hospital, the availability of the blood bag
